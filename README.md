This C program constructs a binary search tree (BST) from its inorder and postorder traversals and performs a breadth-first search (BFS) traversal on the constructed BST.
A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree in which all the nodes in the left subtree have values less than the root node, and all the nodes in the right subtree have values greater than the root node.

The program reads two traversals of the BST: inorder and postorder. With these traversals, it constructs the corresponding BST. 
Then, it performs a breadth-first search traversal on the constructed BST to print the elements level by level.

The program will output the breadth-first search traversal of the constructed binary search tree.
